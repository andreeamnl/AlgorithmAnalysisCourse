# <p>Analysis of Algorithms</p>
<p>This course teaches a calculus that&nbsp;enables&nbsp;precise&nbsp;quantitative&nbsp;predictions of large combinatorial structures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In addition, this course covers generating functions and real asymptotics and then introduces the symbolic method in the context of applications in the analysis of algorithms and basic structures such as permutations, trees, strings, words, and mappings.</p>
